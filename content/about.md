Rice, Spice, and Whine
======================

Ian swivels in his chair, legs wide, and says bespoke things about his comrades, british television, and something about a quarter neeson. He's holding an Arizona tallboy, ginseng honey. Automated digital music plays behind him.

"I don't write stuff... it's why we have a podcast."

So it's on me, and this is how it goes:

Three guys meet from time to time to play with a tape recorder. Someone asks a question, Eric requests clarification, and Kellen quietly says hilarious things. Ian somehow manages to wrap up every episode with a morality minute.
